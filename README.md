# forthASM
an implementation of forth in x86 assembly. it has compiled words &amp; conditionals.

checkout the forth2.asm in the 'antirestaurant' branch

written while at the Recurse Center in spring'17 with occasional guidance from the incredible @saulpw

it doesn't do a lot, but it does do:
- basic math calculations
- compile phrases to the dictionary
- conditional execution with IF/ELSE/THEN

one day i will get to the pearl (DO/DOES), but probably not for a while.

in the meantime, there's another forth interpreter (written in haskell), in the fn_ptr_graph dsp CLI:
